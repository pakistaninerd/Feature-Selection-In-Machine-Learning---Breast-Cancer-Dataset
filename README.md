# Feature-Selection-In-Machine-Learning---Breast-Cancer-Dataset
Feature selection involves picking the set of features that are most relevant to the target variable. This helps in reducing the complexity of your model, as well as minimizing the resources required for training and inference. This has greater effect in production models where you maybe dealing with terabytes of data or serving millions of requests.

In this project , we will go through  the different supervised techniques in performing feature selection on the Breast Cancer Dataset.
